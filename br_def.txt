    whatItDoes:
      "Local-first issue tracking for AI agents. SQLite for fast local queries, JSONL export for git-friendly collaboration. Full dependency graph with blocking/blocked-by relationships, priorities P0-P4.",
    whyItsUseful:
      "Your issues travel with your repo - no external service required. Non-invasive design: never runs git commands automatically. Agents can create, update, and close issues with simple CLI commands. The bd alias provides backward compatibility.",
