# ShellCheck configuration for ACFS

# SC2015: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true.
# We use this pattern intentionally for error handling (e.g., cmd || true)
#
# SC2317: Command appears to be unreachable. Check usage (or ignore if invoked indirectly).
# We use dynamic function calls via function references (e.g., "$fix_function" "fix")
#
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that.
# Intentional - we use single quotes to pass literal strings to subshells
#
# SC1091: Not following: file was not specified as input
# Dynamic sourcing of related scripts is intentional
#
# SC2059: Don't use variables in printf format string
# Intentional - we use ANSI color variables in format strings
#
# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Many variables are used by sourcing scripts or for documentation
#
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Acceptable risk in simple cases where the command always succeeds
#
# SC2030/SC2031: Variable modified in subshell
# Intentional pattern in pipeline processing
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Intentional word splitting in some cases for argument expansion
#
# SC2002: Useless cat
# Sometimes cat is clearer for readability in pipelines
#
# SC2076: Remove quotes from right-hand side of =~
# SC2128: Expanding an array without an index
# SC2178: Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string
# SC2120/SC2119: Function references arguments, but none are ever passed
# These are pre-existing patterns in newproj TUI code
#
# SC2001/SC2028/SC2129/SC2153/SC2181/SC2295: Style and info-level suggestions
# Accepted patterns in this codebase
